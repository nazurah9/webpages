                So to start, I grew up in a barn just like the picture shown below with all the animals and it was great! I get to interact with all the cows and 
                donkeys throughout my childhood. They even taught me how to program! Due to them not having opposable thumbs, I have to do a lot of self learning 
                in order to get up to speed with your average programmer.

            <p class="contentBody">
                When I first saw a horse, I was flabbergasted because it is such a magnificent animal. Not every day that you get to see a horse, especially in Singapore. 
                I can only wish that this horse can survive for long and become my best friend when I'm older. There was also an owl that taught me how to do HTML but I lost 
                contact with him so I did not get to learn how to do animation on web pages.

                After a certain incident happened with a donkey and a horse, I have finally realized my true calling. I am meant for things greater than just taking care 
                of animals and learning JavaScript from a bunch of barn inhabitants. I simply cannot accept that fact that I am destined to hang around barn animals for 
                as long as I live as that is not very radical.

            <h2 style="color: white">I am now AWAKENED</h2>
            <p class="contentBody">
                I shall no longer tolerate these animals' shenanigans. While I am grateful to them for teaching me JavaScript, I have had enough of their pranks which they
                uploaded to their YouTube channel PrankNation. I will no longer be the subject of their cheeky activities. From now on, I am my own woman, I am finally free.

                I went on an worked with Jeff Bezos to create one of the greatest website of all time, Amazon Web Service. However, I woke up from my slumber shortly
                after and I realized that nothing has happened and all of these has been a dream. The question in, how long have I been sleeping for and what has transpired
                during my hibernation. These are some mysteries that I will have to solve for the sake of justice and fairness.
